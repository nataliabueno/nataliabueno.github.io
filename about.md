I am an  assistant  professor  at  Emory  University.  My  research  interests  are comparative  politics,  public  policy, housing policy,  elections, and misinformation. 

I examine the causes on  nonstate  welfare  provision,  the  consequences  of  public  policies, specifically housing policy,  on  political behavior, elections, and misinformation. My teaching focuses on Latin American politics, public policy, and research methods. I use a multi-method approach with an emphasis in causal inference.

My has been published at *American Journal of Political Science*, *Journal of Politics*, *Comparative Political Studies*, *World Politics*, and *Latin American Research Review*, among other outlets. 

My dissertation was the 2019 recipient of the *Harold D. Lasswell Award* for best  dissertation  in  the  field  of  public  policy  and  the  2018  *James  G.  March  award*  by  Yale’s Political Science department. My work received and an honorable mention for the *Sérgio Buarque de Holanda Award* from Latin American Studies Association's Brazil Section for the best article  in  the  social  sciences and co-recipient  of  the  2021  *Best  Public  Policy  Paper*  by  APSA's Public  Policy  Section.

Why do governments delegate welfare provision to nonstate organizations? In several emerging welfare  states, as the  state  grows,  so  do nongovernmental organizations. Rather  than  being  a symptom of weak governance or an apparent solution to government inefficiency, funding private charities  to  provide  public  services  is  a  tactic that governments  deliberately  deploy  to  engender electoral support. Furthermore,delegation is also a consequence of connections between NGO and government staff that create channels of information that favor connected nonstate organizations. I examine these claims using original, fine-grained data from Brazil and a multi-method approach.
