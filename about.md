I am an  assistant  professor  at  Emory  University. My  research  interests  are comparative  politics,  public  policy, housing policy,  elections, and misinformation. 

I examine the causes on  nonstate  welfare  provision,  the  consequences  of  public  policies, specifically housing policy,  on  political behavior, elections, and misinformation. My teaching focuses on Latin American politics, public policy, and research methods. I use a multi-method approach with an emphasis in causal inference.

My research has been published or is forthcoming at *American Journal of Political Science*, *American Political Science Review*, *British Journal of Political Science*, *Comparative Political Studies*, *Journal of Quantitative Description: Digital Media*, *Journal of Politics*, *Latin American Research Review*, *World Politics*, among other outlets. 

My research has received awards or honorable mentions by the American Political Science Association, APSA's Public  Policy  Section (twice), Latin American American Studies Association's Brazil Section, Red para el Estudio de la Economía Política de América Latina (REPAL), and Yale's Department of Political Science. I have also received funding from Meta, Stanford Internet Lab, MIT Gov/Lab, EGAP LatAm, SciBR, CNPq, Yale's ISPS and MacMillan Center, IPEA, among others.
