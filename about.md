I am an  assistant  professor  at  Emory  University. For Spring 2023, I am a visiting fellow at the Kellogg Institute for International Studies.  My  research  interests  are comparative  politics,  public  policy, housing policy,  elections, and misinformation. 

I examine the causes on  nonstate  welfare  provision,  the  consequences  of  public  policies, specifically housing policy,  on  political behavior, elections, and misinformation. My teaching focuses on Latin American politics, public policy, and research methods. I use a multi-method approach with an emphasis in causal inference.

My research has been published at *American Journal of Political Science*, *British Journal of Political Science*, *Comparative Political Studies*, *Journal of Politics*, *Latin American Research Review*, *World Politics*, among other outlets. 

My research has received awards or honorable mentions by the American Political Science Association, APSA's Public  Policy  Section, Latin American American Studies Association's Brazil Section, Red para el Estudio de la Economía Política de América Latina (REPAL), and Yale's Department of Political Science. I have also received funding from Facebook, MIT Gov/Lab, EGAP LatAm, SciBR, CNPq, Yale's ISPS and MacMillan Center, IPEA, among others.

**Public money, private organizations: the distributive politics of NGOs**
======

Why do governments delegate welfare provision to nonstate organizations? In several emerging welfare  states, as the  state  grows,  so  do nongovernmental organizations. Rather  than  being  a symptom of weak governance or an apparent solution to government inefficiency, funding private charities  to  provide  public  services  is  a  tactic that governments  deliberately  deploy  to  engender electoral support. Furthermore,delegation is also a consequence of connections between NGO and government staff that create channels of information that favor connected nonstate organizations. I examine these claims using original, fine-grained data from Brazil and a multi-method approach.
