I am an  assistant  professor  at  Emory  University. My  research  interests  are comparative  politics,  public  policy, housing policy, and elections.

I examine the causes on  nonstate  welfare  provision,  the  consequences  of  public  policies, specifically housing policy,  on  political behavior, and elections. My teaching focuses on Latin American politics, public policy, and research methods. I use a multi-method approach with an emphasis in causal inference.

My research has been published or is forthcoming at *American Journal of Political Science*, *American Political Science Review*, *British Journal of Political Science*, *Comparative Political Studies*, *Journal of Quantitative Description: Digital Media*, *Journal of Politics*, *Latin American Research Review*, *World Politics*, among other outlets. 

I received the Clarence Stone Scholar Award by APSA's Urban and Local Politics Section in 2024. My research on nonstate welfare provision has received APSA's Harold D. Lasswell Award for best dissertation in the field of public policy (2019), the James G. March award by Yale's Political Science department (2018), and an honorable mention for the Sérgio Buarque de Holanda Award for best paper in the social sciences, Latin American Studies Association’s Brazil Section (2019). My work on public policy and housing has received the Best Paper on Public Policy Award by APSA's Public Policy Section (2021), Best Paper by REPAL (Red para el Estudio de la Economía Política de América Latina, 2022), and the Best Comparative Policy Paper Award by APSA's Public Policy Section (2024). 

My work has been supported by Meta, Stanford Internet Observatory, MIT Gov/Lab, EGAP LatAm, SciBR, CNPq, Yale's ISPS and MacMillan Center, IPEA, among others.
