I am an  assistant  professor  at  Emory  University. My  research  interests  are comparative  politics,  public  policy, housing policy,  elections, and misinformation. 

I examine the causes on  nonstate  welfare  provision,  the  consequences  of  public  policies, specifically housing policy,  on  political behavior, elections, and misinformation. My teaching focuses on Latin American politics, public policy, and research methods. I use a multi-method approach with an emphasis in causal inference.

My research has been published or is forthcoming at *American Journal of Political Science*, *American Political Science Review*, *British Journal of Political Science*, *Comparative Political Studies*, *Journal of Quantitative Description: Digital Media*, *Journal of Politics*, *Latin American Research Review*, *World Politics*, among other outlets. 

My research on nonstate welfare provision has received the 2019 Harold D. Lasswell Award for best dissertation in the field of public policy, the 2018 James G. March award by Yale's Political Science department, and an honorable mention for the 2019 Sérgio Buarque de Holanda Award for best paper in the social sciences, Latin American Studies Association’s Brazil Section. My work on public policy and housing has received the 2021 Best Paper on Public Policy Award by APSA Public Policy Section, the 2022 Best Paper by REPAL (Red para el Estudio de la Economía Política de América Latina), and the 2024 APSA Public Policy Section’s Best Comparative Policy Paper Award. I am the recipient of the 2024 Clarence Stone Scholar Award by APSA's Urban and Local Politics Section. I have also received funding from Meta, Stanford Internet Observatory, MIT Gov/Lab, EGAP LatAm, SciBR, CNPq, Yale's ISPS and MacMillan Center, IPEA, among others.
